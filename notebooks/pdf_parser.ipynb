After transfer-orbit injection, all TT&C functions will be performed under the control of the A2100 Satellite Operations Center (ASOC) located in Littleton, Colorado. To achieve the on-station operational orbit, the A2100 spacecraft is first injected by the launch vehicle into an inclined elliptical transfer orbit with its apogee at synchronous altitude. After the post separation orbit is established and attitude references obtained, seven separate LAE burns will reduce orbit inclination and increase the perigee in preparation for HCT orbit raising. HCT orbit raising will insert the spacecraft into a near-synchronous orbit.\n",
